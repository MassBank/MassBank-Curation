# MassBank-Curation

Playground and discussion platform for implementation of curation into MassBank. This platform was separated from MassBank server development (https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-web) because discussions about curation of chemical information is maybe a topic of broader interest and not only related to MassBank.

## Purposes of this platform
* Discussion of general issues of curation of chemical information and technical meta data
* Discussion of specific issues of curation of chemical and technical meta data in MassBank records
* Development of general and MassBank specific tools for curation

## Note
Issues should be submitted with a more general scope in order to improve curation. Issues regarding very specific errors in single records or missing info tags will be ignored or closed. We will implement a specific record repository in future which is the correct place to report minor issues in records. The quality of the submitted mass spectra is in responsibility of the record authors and thus will be not subject of any curation.
